## Nanobloc (Project 3)
#### by Sean Ko 

### Overview 
Nanobloc is a speculative technology and community choose-your-own-adventure game on the topic of using new technology to address food and nutrition accessibility for lower income communities. As the player, you will made key decisions that will either make or break the launch of Nanobloc to the rest of the world. 

This repository includes the sketch.js source code, as well as utilizing the p5.2dadventure.js, p5.clickable.js, and p5.play.js files. The interactions and adventure states are outlined and managed through the adventureStates.csv, clickableLayout.csv, and interactionTable.csv files located in the data folder. Nanobloc then takes these states and interactions and puts them into a playable code. The sketch.js file shows how all of the assets are loaded and animated, and how each clickable decision leads the player further to the next scenario, or to a dead end.
